# Sikotic's Prework Study Guide

## Description

This Prework study guide was created to help me keep track of some of the notes I may need before beginning my coding bootcamp in ernest. It allowed me to practice some of the valuable skills needed to begin to understand coding.

Having this prework study guide will give me something to refer back to as I learn and grow, as well as something I can personally come in and edit and update as needed to keep key notes readily available to me. It will also act as a space for me to test new things as I learn them!

Through this development so far I have learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

To use this study guide you will see there are different sections that refer to the different things I have learned so far; HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. To get some quick info about each simply refer to the boxes and look over the presented notes.

This guide also contains some JavaScript visible via DevTools Console. IF you open the DevTools Console you can see that it lists the topics to choose from and will even randomly select on of the topics available to start with.
